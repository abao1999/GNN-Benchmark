# GNN-Benchmark

This project benchmarks several graph neural network models on various datasets and hardware, including ThetaGPU (which uses NVIDIA DGX A100 nodes) and AI testbeds from several startups (Cerebras, SambaNova, Graphcore, Groq). Currently focusing on datasets from scientific experiments (especially particle physics), and benchmark datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) Project. Open to suggestions!
